# Overview
In *Sea Trader* you, a sea merchant, set out on a 100-day voyage (in regular mode, see [Game Mode](#game-modes)) to sail between ports, visit markets, and gain wealth and popularity to score the most points at the end of the game.

# Quick Start
No installation is required! Run the game directly from your terminal:

```bash
$ npx ctrader
```

> Tested on: *iTerm version 3.5.10* and *Warp version 2024.11.21*.

# How to Play
*Sea Trader* is played entirely in your terminal, using only the keyboard.

## Game Modes
The game has two modes: classic mode, and extended mode. The difference between these modes is that classic mode lasts for 100 days only. Extended mode allows you to keep sailing for more than 100 days, but your score will have a penalty for the extra days.

## Scoring
Your score is calculated based on:
- **Total wealth** accumulated
- **Ship upgrades** that influence its capacity and speed
- **Ship's condition**: Damage to your ship harms your score
- **Days played:** Additional days in extended mode reduce your score

## Gameplay Tips
- **Watch market trends:** Prices are updated every 14 days. Buy low and sell high!
- **Plan efficient routes:** Save time and maximize trade opportunities.
- **Avoid overloading your ship:** Too much cargo slows you down.
- **Be prepared for events:** They are more likely as your wealth grow or during the late stages of your voyage.
