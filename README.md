## Overview

**Sea Trader** is a turn-based strategic trading game in which the player takes a role of a maritime merchant, sailing between ports in East Asia trying to maximize their profit.

## How to play
The game is played over a hundred days. Each day you can buy and sell variety of goods from the local market: Wheat, Tea, Spices, Clay, and Opium. Sailing between ports takes time, between 1-6 days, so plan your travels well!  
During your voyages you may encounter pirates that you'll have to fight or run away from. If your ship gets damaged, you can visit the shipyard to get your ship repaired or even upgrade your ship to a bigger, faster model.

## Installation

The game will start in your terminal window. To exit the game you can press the `Esc` key.
